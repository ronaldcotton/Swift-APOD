### Abstract
[Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomy_Picture_of_the_Day) is a website provided by NASA and Michigan Technological University (MTU) where the pictures and descriptions often relate to current events in astronomy and space exploration containing text, visible images and copyright information, if not Public Domain.
More information is in the **/docs** [pdf.](docs/apod.pdf)

If using this for your own application, replace apiKey with your own vs. using the default **DEMO_KEY.**  Apply for your own [API key](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key) or get more [information](https://api.nasa.gov/api.html#authentication) about NASA API key.

### TODO
